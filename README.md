Devboxes are portable development environments powered by Docker.  
Free your Host System of unnecessary dependency clutter.

## Quick Start 🏁

Follow the list below:

1. Clone this repo somewhere locally and enter that directory.
2. Run installer `source installer.sh`.
3. Open one of your projects and execute `devbox init` command to copy over a *docker-compose.yml* template.
4. `devbox up` and you are up and running.
5. Eg. if you are using *railsbox* just run commands in the project dir prepending them with `db`, like so `db rails server`.
6. You can now get rid of all your dev deps on the host machine as they are now living in your devboxes. It's quite magical! 🌈
